## How to start

### using WINDOWS

not too straight forward but easy enough  

We will wirst winget opam  
then check if that worked 

```
opam --version
```
then we do  
```
opam init
```
or first install a switch, as in
```
opam switch create 4.14.0
```

basically, you can follow the instructions / advices the prompt 'll give ya  
happy coding!  

### using Linux  

oh ya! using Linux ofc is much more straight forward as usual:  

```
sudo apt install opam
```
```
opam --version
```
```
opam init
```
```
ocaml
```
literally Done.  

Happy one!
