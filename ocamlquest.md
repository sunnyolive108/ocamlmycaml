## OCaml Quest

Quest:  

1. Rewrite a *not* function in pattern matching style.  
2. Use pattern matching to write a function which, given a positive integer *n*,  
   returns the sum of all the integers from 1 to *n*  
3. Use pattern matching to write a function which, given two numbers *x* and *n*,  
   computes *x^n*  
4. What does >> match 1 + 1 with 2 -> match 2 + 2 with 3 -> 4 | 4 -> 5 evaluate to and why?  
   Can you re-write it in pattern matching?  
5. There is a special pattern x..y to denote continuous ranges of characters,  
   for example 'a'..'z' will match all lower case letters of the alphabet.  
   Write functions *islower* and *isupper*, each of type << char -> bool >>, 
   to decide on the case of a given letter.
